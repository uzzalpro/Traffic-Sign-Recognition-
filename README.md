# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-using CNN & Keras: self-driving cars in which the passenger can fully depend on the car
for traveling. But to achieve level 5 autonomous, it is necessary for vehicles to understand and follow all traffic rules.
we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories.
With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous
vehicles.
